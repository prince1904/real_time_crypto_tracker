# real_time_crypto_tracker
I develop a Java application that fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices from a public API and displays them in a user-friendly graphical interface. The application should provide the ability to select specific cryptocurrencies from a list and update their prices in real-time at regular intervals.

# Requirements:
1. The application should fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices from a public API. You may use any publicly available cryptocurrency API of your choice (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap).

2. The application's graphical interface should include:
   - A list of cryptocurrencies with checkboxes for selection.
   - A section to display the selected cryptocurrencies' names and real-time prices.
   - A button to start and stop updating the prices.
   - A refresh rate option (e.g., every 5 seconds) to update the prices.

3. The selected cryptocurrencies' prices should update automatically at the specified refresh rate while the application is running.

4. Handle any potential errors or exceptions gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience.

5. The code should be well-organized, easy to understand, and follow best practices.
